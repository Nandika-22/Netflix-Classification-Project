🧠 Smart EDA and Outlier Detection
📊 Project Overview

This project automates the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and identifies outliers in datasets using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method. It provides quick statistical summaries, visualizations, and insights to help data scientists and analysts understand data distributions, detect anomalies, and make better business decisions.

🧩 Key Features

Automated EDA report generation

Visual insights for numerical and categorical variables

Outlier detection using IQR

Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships

Clean and organized workflow for any dataset

🧠 Skills & Tools Used

Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
Techniques: EDA, Data Cleaning, Visualization, Correlation Analysis, Outlier Detection (IQR Method)

🎯 Outcome

The Smart EDA system simplifies data understanding by providing a quick summary of data quality, feature relationships, and outlier insights — enabling faster and more informed data-driven decisions.
